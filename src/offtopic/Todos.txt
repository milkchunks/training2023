1. the weird stuff with -cir verbs in 1s (like traducir -> tradujo)
2. check to make sure that stem changers work
3. technically i should use a layout but i dont care
4. global variables should technically be methods (like getter and setter or a method that clears text) but i don't care
5. use two action listeners, one for button and one for answer box. also implement in a way that doesn't suck
